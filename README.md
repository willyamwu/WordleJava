# Wordle Java Edition
This is a Java version of the game wordle that I created in my CSII class!

## Instructions
The goal is to guess the five letter word in six tries.

Red - the letter is not in the word.

Yellow - the letter is in the word but not in the right spot.

Green - the letter is in the right spot.

Enter in "e" to exit or restart.
